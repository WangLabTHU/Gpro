# GPrO: Generate, Predict and Optimize 3 steps to design artifitial promoters
## Install
`git clone https://github.com/WangLabTHU/Gpro.git`
## Quick Start
Using our data to quick start Gpro
### Demo 1: Design constitutive promoters of E. coli
In our previous research *'Synthetic promoter design in Escherichia coli based on a deep generative network'*, we designed artifitial promoters which had successfully expressed in E. coli. Using **Gpro** can easily reappear our result.

Train the generator using  natural E. coli constitutive promoters sequences:
```
import gpro
generator = gpro.Generators.WGAN()
generator.BuildModel('data/seq_ecoli.txt')
generator.Train()
```
Generate promoter sequences:
```
import numpy as np
N = 100000000 # the number of sequences to generate
seq = generator.Generator(np.random.normal(size=(N,generator.Z_DIM) ))
```
Train the Predictor using E. coli expression data:
```
predictor = gpro.Predictors.CNN()
predictor.BuildModel('data/exp_ecoli.txt')
predictor.Train()
```
Predict the expression of artifitial promoters:
```
exp = predictor.Predictor(seq)
```
Filter the Top 100 expression promoters to experimentï¼š
```
I = np.argsort(exp)
I = I[::-1] # in descending order of expression
seqout = seq[I[:100]]
```

### Demo 2: Design promoter highly expression in yeast cell
To repressent all function of **Gpro**, we provide the design process of highly-expressed promoter in yeast cell. In this section, we applied genetic algorithm to optimize promoter sequences.

Train Generator use natural yeast core promoter:
```
import gpro
gen = gpro.Generators.AAE()
gen.BuildModel('data/seq_yeast.txt')
gen.Train()
```
Promoters generated by generator are similar to input data

The following two graph would be saved at folder 'log/' after trained.

Figure a present 6-mer frequences of natural promoter and generated promoter. Figure b plot JS distance of 6-mer distribution between generated sequences and train set (JS_train), generated sequences and valid set (JS_valid), train set and valid set (JS control, treated as performance of ideal generator).

Train the Predictor using yeast expression data:
```
pred = gpro.Predictors.CNN()
pred.BuildModel('data/exp_yeastt.txt')
pred.Train()
```
Predictor learn the motif features of yeast

Scatter of preditive value and true value would be saved at folder 'log/'.

Using Genetic algorithm to optimize promoter sequences:
```
opt = gpro.Optimizers.GA(gen.Generator,pred.Pridictor)
opt.run()
```
Promoters optimized by Optimizer have higher expression than natural promoters

Function score of generated sequences during optimizing, optimized sequences and following graph would be saved at folder 'EAresult/'
